							<h1>Welcome to Songscape</h1>
 							<p>Songscape is an exploration into songs' expansion across the world and the cultural trends of music taste that arise between and within nations. Observe popular songs' evolution and associations in our geographical and semantic analysis.</p>
  							<p>In our modern globalised world, music is more accessible than ever. The rise of the internet and streaming services have meant that in the majority of countries on the planet, anyone can listen to music from almost anywhere.</p>
							<p>This project investigates the new Global Musical Landscape. Using data analysis and visualisation we are exploring the flows of music across the globe, the musical identities of individual countries, and how these identities relate to and potentially affect one another.</p>
